                <b>New high-speed video suggests efforts to keep their backs to the light leads to <span>erratic</span> flight</b>
            </p>
            <p>The insects flying in circles around your porch light aren’t captivated by the light. Instead, they may have lost track of which way is up, high-speed infrared camera data suggest.</p>
            <p>
                Moths and other insects naturally turn their backs toward light. But when insects turn their backs on artificial light sources, their sense of direction seems to go
                <span>topsy-turvy</span>, researchers report January 30 in Nature Communications. The insects may lose track of where the ground is, leaving them flying in circles or diving toward the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                The findings are the first “satisfying answer to a long-standing phenomenon” of how moths and other insects flock to streetlamps and flames, says evolutionary biologist Florian Altermatt of the University of Zurich who was not involved with the study. “It was also interesting to see that it was an actually rather simple explanation,
                <span>defying</span> the previous, more complex ones.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Those hypotheses range from flying insects being blinded by light and becoming trapped, to insects interpreting light sources as a place to fly for a quick escape. Another idea suggests that the light of the moon serves as a compass, and
                <span>nocturnal</span> insects mistakenly use human-made lights to navigate the world. These lights can be deadly for insects (SN: 8/31/21).
            </p>
            <p>Just as pilots flying planes have <span>myriad</span> tools to work out which way is up when they’re gaining speed, flying insects may turn their backs on the sky’s light to keep their feet pointing toward the ground. “It’s a really good idea until somebody invents the LED,” says entomologist Samuel Fabian of Imperial College London, “at which point it’s a very bad idea.”</p>
            <p>Fabian and colleagues used high-speed infrared cameras to track how artificial lights affected the flight of a variety of insects. At a field station in Costa Rica, the team watched as wild insects from 10 <span>orders</span>, including moths and flies, circled endlessly around hanging or standing lights. Others flew upward in a steep climb, losing speed until they couldn’t fly any higher. When the light source pointed up, some individuals flipped over and headed for the ground.</p>
            <p>During flight, the insects consistently kept lights at their back, even if they ended up crashing. The same was true of moths and dragonflies observed in the lab.</p>
            <p>The results “didn’t fit with any of the theories that had been proposed before,” says coauthor Yash Sondhi, an evolutionary biologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History’s McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity. The insects weren’t flying toward the light as they would if it symbolized an escape route. Nor were they flying in smooth spirals, which would suggest the light acted as a compass.</p>
            <p>Instead, “it’s a bit like somebody’s grabbed [a pilot’s] joystick and is pulling it in the wrong direction,” Fabian says.</p>
            <p>
                Normal flight was restored when the positioning of a skylike artificial light was opposite the ground. Crash landings were common when the team illuminated a white sheet on the floor. But when a white sheet stretched into a
                <span>canopy</span> above the floor was bathed in <span>diffuse</span> light, like the sky would be, insects flew through without getting trapped by the light.
            </p>
            <p>In the lab, there were some exceptions. Fruit flies (Drosophila species) — which can fly in the dark — weren’t strongly affected by the light. Oleander hawk moths (Daphnis nerii) could also fly over ultraviolet or LED lights without being thrown off course. In the wild, though, the moths still crash. It’s unclear why, Sondhi says, but one possibility is that the insects might sometimes suppress their response to light. Or it could be something that individuals learn over time.</p>
            <p>
                While it’s clear that artificial light can put insects on a crash course, more research is needed to confirm if it’s happening because insects use the sky’s light for navigation,
                <span>irrespective of</span> the presence of artificial light, says animal and visual ecologist Brett Seymoure of the University of Texas at El Paso, who wasn’t involved with the research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seymoure, Sondhi and other scientists are also teaming up to explore other unanswered questions about light pollution’s effects on insects, such as how <span>susceptible</span>
                insects may be at different latitudes.
            </p>
            <p>Another question Seymoure and colleagues are exploring is whether putting fixtures on lights, so insects can’t see much light at all, could make streetlights less attractive for flying by insects. “Now that we have the mechanism of how moths are flying to these lights, we can now better design light fixtures that will make it so that they’re not actually doing this behavior,” Seymoure says.</p>

            <p>
                <b>An artificial intelligence model learned words from audio and video of a baby</b>
            </p>
            <p>The AI program was way less cute than a real baby. But like a baby, it learned its first words by seeing objects and hearing words.</p>
            <p>
                After being fed dozens of hours of video of a growing
                <span>tot</span> exploring his world, an artificial intelligence model could more often than not associate words — ball, cat and car, among others — with their images, researchers report in the Feb. 2 Science. This AI <span>feat</span>, the team says, offers a new window into the mysterious ways that humans learn words (SN: 4/5/17).
            </p>
            <p>
                Some ideas of language learning hold that humans are born with specialized knowledge that allows us to
                <span>soak up</span> words, says Evan Kidd, a psycholinguist at the Australian National University in Canberra who was not involved in the study. The new work, he says, is “an elegant demonstration of how infants may not necessarily need a lot of in-built specialized cognitive mechanisms to begin the process of word learning.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The new model keeps things simple, and small — a
                <span>departure</span> from many of the large language models, or LLMs, that <span>underlie</span> today’s chatbots. Those models learned to talk from enormous <span>pools</span> of data. “These AI systems we have now work remarkably well, but require astronomical amounts of data, sometimes trillions of words to train on,” says computational cognitive scientist Wai Keen Vong, of New York University.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that’s not how humans learn words. “The input to a child isn’t the entire internet like some of these LLMs. It’s their parents and what’s being provided to them,” Vong says. Vong and his colleagues intentionally built a more realistic model of language learning, one that relies on just a
                <span>sliver</span> of data. The question is, “Can [the model] learn language from that kind of input?”
            </p>
            <p>To narrow the inputs down from the entirety of the internet, Vong and his colleagues trained an AI program with the actual experiences of a real child, an Australian baby named Sam. A head-mounted video camera recorded what Sam saw, along with the words he heard, as he grew and learned English from 6 months of age to just over 2 years.</p>
            <p>
                The researchers’ AI program — a type called a neural network — used about 60 hours of Sam’s recorded experiences, connecting objects in Sam’s videos to the words he heard
                <span>caregivers</span> speak as he saw them. From this data, which represented only about 1 percent of Sam’s waking hours, the model would then “learn” how closely aligned the images and spoken words were.
            </p>
            <p>As this process happened <span>iteratively</span>, the model was able to pick up some key words. Vong and his team tested their model similar to a lab test used to find out which words babies know. The researchers gave the model a word— crib, for instance. Then the model was asked to find the picture that contained a crib from a group of four pictures. The model landed on the right answer about 62 percent of the time. Random guessing would have yielded correct answers 25 percent of the time.</p>
            <p>“What they’ve shown is, if you can make these associations between the language you hear and the context, then you can get off the ground when it comes to word learning,” Kidd says. Of course, the results can’t say whether children learn words in a similar way, he says. “You have to think of [the results] as existence proofs, that this is a possibility of how children might learn language.”</p>
            <p>
                The model made some mistakes. The word hand proved to be
                <span>tricky</span>. Most of the training images that involved hand happened at the beach, leaving the model confused over hand and sand.
            </p>
            <p>Kids get <span>tangled up</span> with new words, too (SN: 11/20/17). A common mistake is overgeneralizing, Kidd says, calling all adult men “Daddy,” for instance. “It would be interesting to know if [the model] made the kinds of errors that children make, because then you know it’s on the right track,” he says.</p>
            <p>Verbs might also pose problems, particularly for an AI system that doesn’t have a body. The dataset’s visuals for running, for instance, come from Sam running, Vong says. “From the camera’s perspective, it’s just shaking up and down a lot.”</p>
            <p>The researchers are now feeding even more audio and video data to their model. “There should be more efforts to understand what makes humans so efficient when it comes to learning language,” Vong says.</p>

                <b>The Three Laws of Cloning will protect clones and <span>advance</span> science</b>
            </p>
            <p>In his 1950 science-fiction novel <i>I, Robot</i>, Isaac Asimov presented the Three Laws of Robotics: “1. A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.”</p>
            <p>
                The irrational fears people express today about cloning
                <span>parallel</span> those surrounding robotics half a century ago. So I would like to propose Three Laws of Cloning that also clarify three misunderstandings: 1. A human clone is a human being no less unique in his or her <span>personhood</span> than an identical twin. 2. A human clone has all the rights and privileges that accompany this legal and moral status. 3. A human clone is to be <span>accorded</span> the dignity and respect due any member of our species.
            </p>
            <p>Although such simplifications risk erasing the rich nuances found in ethical debates over pioneering research, they do aid in <span>attenuating</span> <span>risible</span> fears often associated with such advances. It appears that the Raelians have not succeeded in Xeroxing themselves, but it is clear that someone, somewhere, sometime soon is going to generate a human clone. And once one team has succeeded, it will be Katy bar the door for others to bring on the clones.</p>
            <p>If cloning produces genetic <span>monstrosities</span> that render it impractical as another form of fertility enhancement, then it will not be necessary to ban it, because no one will use it. If cloning does work, however, there is no reason to forbid it, because the three common reasons given for implementing restrictions are myths. I call them the Identical Personhood Myth, the Playing God Myth, and the Human Rights and Dignity Myth.</p>
            <p>
                The Identical Personhood Myth is well represented by activist Jeremy Rifkin: “It’s a horrendous crime to make a Xerox of someone. You’re putting a human into a genetic
                <span>straitjacket</span>.” <i>Baloney</i>. He and fellow cloning critics have the argument bass ackward. As environmental determinists, they should be arguing: “Clone all you like — you’ll never produce another you, because environment matters as much as heredity.” The best scientific evidence to date indicates that roughly half the variance among us is accounted for by genetics and the rest by environment. It is impossible to duplicate the near-infinite number of <span>permutations</span> that come into play during the development of each individual, so cloning is no threat to unique personhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Playing God Myth has numerous promoters, among the latest being Stanley M. Hauerwas, a professor of theological ethics at Duke University: “The very attempt to clone a human being is evil. The assumption that we must do what we can do is fueled by the Promethean desire to be our own creators.” In support of this myth, he is not alone. A 1997
                <i>Time</i>/CNN poll revealed that 74 percent of 1,005 Americans answered “yes” to the question “Is it against God’s will to clone human beings?” <i>Balderdash</i>. Cloning may seem to be “playing God” only because it is unfamiliar. Consider earlier examples of once “God-like” fertility technologies that are now cheerfully embraced because we have become accustomed to them, such as in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Human Rights and Dignity Myth is embodied in the Roman Catholic Church’s official statement against cloning, based on the belief that it denies “the dignity of human
                <span>procreation</span> and of the <span>conjugal</span> union,” as well as in a Sunni Muslim cleric’s demand that “science must be regulated by firm laws to preserve humanity and its dignity.” <i>Bunkum</i>. Clones will be no more alike than twins raised in separate environments, and no one is suggesting that twins do not have rights or dignity or that they should be banned.
            </p>
            <p>Instead of restricting or preventing the technology, I propose that we adopt the Three Laws of Cloning, the principles of which are already incorporated in the laws and language of the U.S. Constitution, and allow science to run its course. The soul of science is found in courageous thought and creative experiment, not in restrictive fear and prohibitions. For science to progress, it must be given the opportunity to succeed or fail. Let’s run the cloning experiment and see what happens.</p>

            <a href='https://michaelshermer.com/sciam-columns/smart-people-believe-weird-things/'>Michael Shermer</a>
            <p>
                <b> Rarely does anyone weigh facts before deciding what to believe </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                In April 1999, when I was on a lecture tour for my book
                <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, the psychologist Robert Sternberg <span>attended</span> my presentation at Yale University. His response to the lecture was both <span>enlightening</span> and <span>troubling</span>. It is certainly entertaining to hear about other people’s weird beliefs, Sternberg reflected, because we are confident that we would never be so foolish. But why do <i>smart</i> people fall for such things? Sternberg’s challenge led to a second edition of my book, with a new chapter <span>expounding</span> on my answer to his question: Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rarely do any of us sit down before a table of facts, weigh them pro and con, and choose the most logical and rational explanation, regardless of what we previously believed. Most of us, most of the time, come to our beliefs for a variety of reasons having little to do with empirical evidence and logical reasoning. Rather, such variables as genetic predisposition, parental
                <span>predilection</span>, sibling influence, peer pressure, educational experience and life impressions all shape the personality preferences that, in conjunction with numerous social and cultural influences, lead us to our beliefs. We then sort through the body of data and select those that most confirm what we already believe, and ignore or <span>rationalize</span> away those that do not.
            </p>
            <p>This phenomenon, called the confirmation bias, helps to explain the findings published in the National Science Foundation’s biennial report (April 2002) on the state of science understanding: 30 percent of adult Americans believe that UFOs are space vehicles from other civilizations; 60 percent believe in ESP; 40 percent think that astrology is scientific; 32 percent believe in lucky numbers; 70 percent accept magnetic therapy as scientific; and 88 percent accept alternative medicine.</p>
            <p>
                Education by itself is no paranormal prophylactic. Although belief in ESP decreased from 65 percent among high school graduates to 60 percent among college graduates, and belief in magnetic therapy dropped from 71 percent among high school graduates to 55 percent among college graduates, that still leaves more than half fully
                <span>endorsing</span> such claims! And for embracing alternative medicine, the percentages actually increase, from 89 percent for high school grads to 92 percent for college grads. We can <span>glean</span> a deeper cause of this problem in another statistic: 70 percent of Americans still do not understand the scientific process, defined in the study as comprehending probability, the experimental method and hypothesis testing. One solution is more and better science education, as indicated by the fact that 53 percent of Americans with a high level of science education (nine or more high school and college science/math courses) understand the scientific process, compared with 38 percent of those with a middle-level science education (six to eight such courses) and 17 percent with a low level (five or fewer courses).
            </p>
            <p>
                The key here is teaching how science works, not just what science has discovered. We recently published an article in
                <i>Skeptic</i> (Vol. 9, No. 3) revealing the results of a study that found no correlation between science knowledge (facts about the world) and paranormal beliefs. The authors, W. Richard Walker, Steven J. Hoekstra and Rodney J. Vogl, concluded: “Students that <span>scored</span> well on these [science knowledge] tests were no more or less skeptical of pseudoscientific claims than students that scored very poorly. Apparently, the students were not able to apply their scientific knowledge to evaluate these pseudoscientific claims. We suggest that this inability stems in part from the way that science is traditionally presented to students: Students are taught what to think but not how to think.”
            </p>
            <p>
                To attenuate these paranormal belief statistics, we need to teach that science is not a database of unconnected
                <span>factoids</span> but a set of methods designed to describe and interpret phenomena, past or present, aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those lacking a fundamental comprehension of how science works, the siren song of pseudoscience becomes too
                <span>alluring</span> to resist, no matter how smart you are.

            <p>
                <b> If the brain <span>mediates</span> all experience, then paranormal phenomena are nothing more than neuronal events </b>
            </p>
            <p>Five centuries ago demons <span>haunted</span> our world, with incubi and succubi <span>tormenting</span> victims as they lay asleep. Two centuries ago spirits haunted our world, with ghosts and <span>ghouls</span> harassing sufferers during all hours of the night. This past century aliens haunted our world, with grays and greens abducting captives and <span>whisking</span> them away for probing and prodding. Nowadays people are reporting out-of-body experiences, floating above their beds. What is going on here? Are these <span>elusive</span> creatures and mysterious phenomena in our world or in our minds? New evidence adds weight to the notion that they are, in fact, products of the brain. Neuroscientist Michael Persinger, in his laboratory at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, for example, can <span>induce</span> all these perceptions in subjects by subjecting their temporal lobes to patterns of magnetic fields. (I tried it myself and had a mild out-of-body experience.)</p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the September 19, 2002, issue of
                <i>Nature</i> reported that neuroscientist Olaf Blanke of Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland and his colleagues were able to bring about out-of-body experiences through electrical stimulation of the right angular gyrus in the temporal lobe of a 43-year old woman suffering from severe epileptic seizures. With initial mild stimulation, she felt she was “sinking into the bed” or “falling from a height.” With more intense stimulation, she said she could “see myself lying in bed, from above, but I only see my legs and lower trunk.” Another trial induced “an <span>instantaneous</span> feeling of ‘lightness’ and ‘floating’ about two meters above the bed, close to the ceiling.”
            </p>
            <p>
                A related study is cited in the 2001 book
                <i>Why God Won’t Go Away</i>. In it, Andrew Newberg of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center and the late Eugene D’Aquili found that when Buddhist monks meditate and Franciscan nuns pray, their brain scans show strikingly low activity in the posterior superior parietal lobe, a region the authors have <span>dubbed</span> the orientation association area (OAA). The OAA provides bearings for the body in physical space; people with damage to this area have a difficult time negotiating their way around a house, for instance. When the OAA is booted up and running smoothly, there is a sharp distinction between self and nonself. When the OAA is in sleep mode — as in deep meditation or prayer — that division breaks down, leading to a blurring of the lines between feeling in body and out of body. Perhaps this is what happens to monks who discern a sense of oneness with the universe, or nuns who feel the presence of God, or alien abductees who believe they are floating out of their beds to the mother ship.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes trauma can become a trigger. The December 15, 2001, issue of the <i>Lancet</i> published a Dutch study in which 12 percent of 344 cardiac patients <span>resuscitated</span> from clinical death reported near-death experiences, some having a sensation of being out of body, others seeing a light at the end of a tunnel. Some even described speaking to dead relatives. Because the everyday occurrence is of stimuli coming from the outside, when a part of the brain abnormally generates these illusions, another part of the brain interprets them as external events. Hence, the abnormal is thought to be the paranormal.</p>
            <p>These studies are only the latest to deliver blows against the belief that mind and spirit are separate from brain and body. In reality, all experience is mediated by the brain. Large brain areas such as the cortex coordinate inputs from smaller brain areas such as the temporal lobes, which themselves <span>collate</span> neural events from still smaller brain modules such as the angular gyrus. Of course, we are not aware of the workings of our own electrochemical systems. What we experience is what philosophers call <span>qualia</span>, or subjective states of thoughts and feelings that arise from a concatenation of neural events.</p>
            <p>It is the fate of the paranormal and the supernatural to be subsumed into the normal and the natural. In fact, there is no paranormal or supernatural; there are only the normal and the natural — and mysteries yet to be explained. It is the job of science, not pseudoscience, to solve those puzzles with natural, rather than supernatural, explanations.</p>

            <p>
                <b>GPs will be able to <span>refer</span> young people, after ‘gaming disorder’ <span>defined</span> as a health problem</b>
            </p>
            <p>The NHS is opening the country’s first specialist clinic to treat children and young adults who are addicted to playing computer games such as Fortnite, Candy Crush and Call of Duty.</p>
            <p>
                Staff will help those aged 13 to 25 whose lives are being
                <span>debilitated</span> by spending countless hours playing games. From Tuesday GPs and other health professionals in England can refer addicts to the service, with treatment starting next month.
            </p>
            <p>It has been set up because of concern about the growing number of children and young people whose heavy use of computer games is causing problems for them, especially with their mental health.</p>
            <p>The clinic will be part of the National Centre for Behavioural Addictions in London. Patients referred to it will be able to <span>attend</span> in person or have an online consultation using Skype.</p>
            <p>“Health needs are constantly changing, which is why the NHS must never stand still. This new service is a response to an emerging problem, part of the increasing pressures that children and young people are exposed to these days,” said Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England.</p>
            <p>The service will be hosted by the Central and North West London mental health trust and be located alongside the National Problem Gambling Clinic.</p>
            <p>
                Clinical psychologists, mental health nurses, therapists and psychiatrists specialising in treating children and young people will work with patients to help
                <span>tackle</span> their addiction.
            </p>
            <p>The World Health Organization last year recognised “gaming disorder” as a medical condition for the first time. It included it in its latest revised edition of the International Classification of Diseases, which tells doctors worldwide what conditions the WHO has accepted to be a disease.</p>
            <p>
                “Gaming disorder is a mental health condition which can have a hugely debilitating effect on people’s lives, both for patients and their families who can be left feeling utterly helpless
                <span>in the wake of</span> their loved one’s addiction,” said Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, director of the NHS’s new Centre for Internet and Gaming Disorder and the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ spokeswoman on behavioural addictions.
            </p>
            <p>“Gaming disorder is not a mental illness to be taken lightly. We are talking about instances where someone may spend up to 12 hours a day playing computer games and can end up becoming socially isolated and lose their job as a result.”</p>
            <p>Countries worldwide are trying to cope with an explosion in gaming and internet addiction. For example, South Korea has banned children under 16 from using online games between midnight and 6am. In China the technology firm Tencent has restricted the number of hours children can spend playing its most popular games.</p>
            <p>Fiona Smith, professional lead for children and young people at the Royal College of Nursing, said: “As technology becomes more accessible and more advanced, it’s unsurprising that more and more young people are potentially being negatively affected by excessive screen time to the point where it affects their daily lives.</p>
            <p>
                “The damage of addiction of any kind goes beyond the child or young person, causing
                <span>distress</span> to parents, families and friends.”
            </p>
            <p>She endorsed Stevens’s call for <span>gambling</span> and internet firms to pay a <span>levy</span> to help fund NHS mental health treatment for those who become addicted to using their products.</p>
            <p>
                “Whilst the NHS has a duty of care and is adapting to these modern challenges, it and taxpayers can’t foot the bill alone. Online gaming firms and global social media firms who make millions of pounds of profit must take more responsibility by keeping their platforms safe, and introduce
                <span>safeguards</span> to reduce the burden on the health service.”

            <p>
                <b><span>Broad-mindedness</span> is a virtue when investigating extraordinary claims, but often they turn out to be pure bunk</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Those of us who practice skepticism for a living often find ourselves
                <span>tiptoeing</span> politely around the PC police, who think that all beliefs and opinions are equal. Thus, when asked, “Are you a debunker?” my initial instinct is to <span>dissemble</span> and mutter something about being an investigator, as if that will soften the blow.
            </p>
            <p>But what need, really, is there to <span>assuage</span>? According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, to debunk is to “remove the nonsense from; to expose false claims or pretensions.” Bunk is slang for “humbug,” and <span>bunkum</span> is “empty claptrap oratory.” Here is some bunk that merits no brook.</p>
            <p><b>Ear coning cleans your ears and mind.</b> The idea is to lie down on your side with your head on a pillow. Then place a long, narrow, cylindrical cone of wax into your ear canal until a tight seal forms. Light the open end of the cone on fire. The negative pressure created will not only remove undesirable earwax, according to Coning Works in Sedona, Ariz., but also provide “spiritual opening and emotional clearing, realignment and cleansing of subtle energy flows, sharpening of mental functioning, vision, hearing, smell, taste and color perception.” The technique “acts as a <span>catalyst</span> to clear out <span>debris</span> from nerve endings allowing for clear vibrational flow to corresponding areas of mind, body and spirit.” Why pay $25 to $75 to have your ears cleaned by your doctor, asks another ear-cone seller, Wholistic Health Solutions, “when you can easily do it at home?”</p>
            <p>Well, <span>for starters</span>, according to a 1996 study conducted by physicians at the Spokane [Wash.] Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic and published in the journal <i>Laryngoscope</i>, “Tympanometric measurements in an ear canal model demonstrated that ear candles do not produce negative pressure,” and thus there was no removal of wax in the eight ears tested. Worse, a survey of 122 otolaryngologists (ear, nose and throat docs) identified 21 ear injuries from ear coning. If one is inclined toward such self-<span>mutilation</span> (or a good <span>chortle</span>), however, I recommend a quick stop at the satirical buttcandle.com, which <span>touts</span> a “gentler alternative to laxatives, enemas and anti-flatulence pills” in the form of a carefully (and gently) placed hollow candle that when burning creates a vacuum that draws out impurities. Best of all, it’s “100% soluble and septic-safe.”</p>
            <p><b>Laundry balls clean clothes.</b> These spherical, toroidal or spiked balls contain no chemicals and yet are purportedly reusable indefinitely in the washing machine to clean, deodorize, sterilize, bleach and soften clothes. But they do not “ionize,” “structure,” “cluster” or “magnetize” water, as various manufacturers claim. They all work on the same principle: washing clothes in soapless warm water does have some cleansing effect, particularly for nongreasy <span>garments</span> mainly soiled by dust, dirt and sweat. But with laundry balls costing from $25 to $75, golf balls are just as effective and a lot cheaper.</p>
            <p>
                <b>A <span>counterfeit</span> pen can detect counterfeit bills.</b>
                Containing <span>tincture</span> of iodine that reacts with the starch in recycled paper to create a black streak, the pen only works to catch counterfeiters who are brainless enough to use cheap paper, thus creating a false sense of security. Meanwhile clever counterfeiters who use high-quality fiber or linen paper containing no starch or whitening agents continue to fleece their marks. Merchants beware: after warning law-enforcement agencies — who ignored him — fellow skeptic James Randi periodically applies commercial spray starch on $50 and $100 bills for recirculation into the economy in the hopes that false pen positives will force the bunkum squads into action.
            </p>
            <p>
                To “buncomize” is to “talk bunkum,” and no one does this with a better vocabulary than pseudoscientists, who
                <span>lace</span> their hokum narratives with scientistic jargon. (One laundry ball manufacturer claims that it “works on ‘Quantum Mechanics’ (Physics), not chemistry, with a method called ‘Structured Water Technology.’” Another uses “infra-red waves that change the molecular structure of the water.”) To “do a bunk” is to “make an escape” or “to depart hurriedly,” a wise move when skeptics arrive on the scene fully armed with steel-jacketed science and armor-piercing reason.

                The cells of adult frogs seem to remember how to regrow lost legs, and a new chemical
                <span>kick starter</span> helps them hop to it.
            </p>
            <p>Scientists have been seeking ways to spur the body to regrow limbs to help people that have undergone an amputation (SN: 6/12/13). Like adult humans, fully grown frogs have a limited ability to replace lost body parts. But a new treatment — a device that delivers a drug cocktail — jump-starts and improves limb regeneration after amputation in frogs, researchers report in the Jan. 26 Science Advances.</p>
            <p>“The cells of the frog already know how to make frog legs,” having done so when the animal was a developing embryo, says Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. “Our goal is to figure out how to convince them to do it again.”</p>
            <p>Levin’s team amputated the right back legs of 115 adult African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) at the knee. Roughly one-third of those frogs received “BioDomes,” silicone sleeves that cover the wound. To another third of the frogs, researchers attached BioDomes holding a silk-based gel that contained five chemicals, including a growth hormone, a nerve growth <span>promoter</span> and an anti-inflammatory substance. The BioDomes stayed on for 24 hours and then were removed from the frogs’ legs. The remaining third didn’t receive any treatments before being placed back in their <span>tanks</span>.</p>
            <p>In animals that received the drug cocktail, “around the four-month mark, we started to see a slight difference in the leg shape,” says Nirosha Murugan, a cancer biologist now at Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada. “With time, that <span>bud</span> … started to take shape into a whole leg.”</p>
            <p>After 18 months, the frogs that received the chemicals had regrown the limbs and had nubs where toes would typically grow. The amputees kicked, stood and pushed off the walls of their tanks using their regrown legs, Levin says.</p>
            <p>
                The BioDome itself promoted some regeneration: The
                <span>stiffness</span> and pressure it creates at the wound seem to lead to conditions that spur growth, Murugan says. But frogs that received the BioDome with drugs grew longer legs with thicker bones. They also had more blood vessels and nerves. And compared with the BioDome-only group, frogs that received the drug mix showed greater sensitivity to touch when their limbs were lightly <span>prodded</span>. Frogs in the control group grew spiky flaps — basically stumps with no function — at the wound site.
            </p>
            <p>“It’s actually remarkable that just a single treatment on one day can cause all this change,” Murugan says.</p>
            <p>
                This first attempt at using a chemical cocktail to
                <span>coax</span> limb regrowth is “a great start,” says John Barker, an orthopedic researcher who recently retired from Goethe University Frankfurt and was not part of the work. With this approach, he says, “there’s no end to what you could try.”
            </p>
            <p>The team has moved on to similar work in mice, using the same cocktail and new ones. Levin’s research also points to electricity’s role in shaping the growth of body parts, so the researchers are adding <span>compounds</span> to the cocktail that alter the electrical state of cells (SN: 12/8/11).</p>
            <p>Someday, scientists want to be able to regrow human limbs and organs. As with the frogs’ legs, human bodies know how to make hands, for example, Barker says. Children under the age of 10 or so can even regrow lost fingertips. In health care, “this whole story of regeneration changes everything,” Barker says. “Instead of treating symptoms, you could literally cure a disease.” For instance, regenerated heart tissue could replace damaged tissue to improve heart function.</p>
            <p>Limbs, however, are more complicated because several types of tissue must <span>coordinate</span>. And researchers lack fundamental information on how bodies form their parts.</p>
            <p>“We don’t understand how collections of cells solve problems” to decide what to build and when to stop, Levin says. “Cracking regenerative medicine is going to require us to do much better about understanding that.”</p>

            <p>
                <b>Not all wrong theories are equal</b>
            </p>
            <p>In belles lettres the <span>witty</span> literary <span>slight</span> has evolved into a genre because, as 20th-century trial lawyer Louis Nizer noted, “A graceful taunt is worth a thousand insults.” To wit, from high culture, Mark Twain: “I didn’t attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it.” Winston Churchill: “He has all the virtues I dislike and none of the vices I admire.” And from pop culture, Groucho Marx: “I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening. But this wasn’t it.” Scientists are no slouches when it comes to pitching invectives at colleagues. Achieving almost canonical status as the ne plus ultra put-down is theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli’s reported harsh critique of a paper: “This isn’t right. It’s not even wrong.” I call this Pauli’s proverb.</p>
            <p>Columbia University mathematician Peter Woit recently employed Pauli’s proverb in his book title, a critique of string theory called <i>Not Even Wrong</i> (Basic Books, 2006). String theory, Woit argues, is not only based on nontestable hypotheses, it depends far too much on the aesthetic nature of its mathematics and the <span>eminence</span> of its proponents. In science, if an idea is not <span>falsifiable</span>, it is not that it is wrong, it is that we cannot determine if it is wrong, and thus it is not even wrong.</p>
            <p>Not even wrong. What could be worse? Being wronger than wrong, or what I call Asimov’s axiom, well stated in his book <i>The Relativity of Wrong</i> (Doubleday, 1988): “When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.”</p>
            <p>Asimov’s axiom holds that science is <span>cumulative</span> and progressive, building on the mistakes of the past, and that even though scientists are often wrong, their wrongness attenuates with continued data collection and theory building. Satellite measurements, for instance, have shown precisely how the earth’s shape differs from a perfect sphere.</p>
            <p>The view that all wrong theories are equal implies that no theory is better than any other. This is the theory of the “strong” social construction of science, which holds that science is <span>inextricably</span> bound to the social, political, economic, religious and ideological predilections of a culture, particularly of those individuals in power. Scientists are knowledge capitalists who produce scientific papers that report the results of experiments conducted to test (and usually support) the hegemonic theories that reinforce the status quo.</p>
            <p>In some extreme cases, this theory that culture shapes the way science is conducted is right. In the mid-19th century, physicians discovered that slaves suffered from <i>drapetomania</i>, or the uncontrollable <span>urge</span> to escape from slavery, and <i>dysaethesia aethiopica</i>, or the tendency to be disobedient. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scientific measurements of racial differences in cognitive abilities found that blacks were inferior to whites. In the mid- 20th century, psychiatrists discovered evidence that allowed them to classify homosexuality as a disease. And until recently, women were considered inherently inferior in science classrooms and corporate boardrooms.</p>
            <p>Such <span>egregious</span> examples, however, do not <span>negate</span> the extraordinary ability of science to <span>elucidate</span> the natural and social worlds. Reality exists, and science is the best tool yet employed to discover and describe that reality. The theory of evolution, even though it is the subject of vigorous debates about the tempo and mode of life’s history, is vastly superior to the theory of creation, which is not even wrong (in Pauli’s sense). As evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins observed on this dispute: “When two opposite points of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly halfway between them. It is possible for one side to be simply wrong.”</p>
            <p>Simply wrong. When people thought that science was unbiased and unbound by culture, they were simply wrong. On the other hand, when people thought that science was completely socially constructed, they were simply wrong. But if you believe that thinking science is unbiased is just as wrong as thinking that science is socially constructed, then your view is not even wronger than wrong.</p>

            <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/15/stroke-of-genius-how-one-developer-created-a-hit-game-in-just-30-minutes'>The Guardian</a>
            <p>
                <b>More than 120,000 PlayStation users have paid £3.29 to pet virtual hamsters, dogs and beavers. What’s behind this madness?</b>
            </p>
            <p>Game development is an expensive and time-consuming business. Right now, 2,000 people are working on the next <span>instalment</span> in Ubisoft’s blockbuster Assassin’s Creed series, across 18 studios around the globe, and it’s a project that will take 2 to 3 years. Imagine how any of those people might feel to learn that last year, a self-taught programmer <span>racked up</span> nearly £280,000 from a series of games he made while sitting in his pants on hot days in a two-bedroom flat in Harlesden. And that each one took him about 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>“The first one, I’ll be honest, probably took seven or eight hours,” says TJ Gardner. “But the subsequent ones – Stroke the Beaver, for example – would have taken about half an hour.”</p>
            <p>Gardner is the creator of the “Stroke” video games, available to download from the PlayStation Store for £3.29 <span>a pop</span>. Each one features a different animal – cats, dogs and hamsters, along with less cuddly creatures such as snakes and fish – and they all follow the same blueprint.</p>
            <p>When you start the game, an image of the animal appears against a plain blue background. In the top left-hand corner of the screen are the words “Strokes 0”. You press X to stroke the animal. The animal flashes briefly. The number in the corner goes up by 1. After 25 strokes, you are rewarded with a bronze trophy. Keep going until you hit 2,000 strokes, and you will receive a platinum award.</p>
            <p>That’s it. There is no animation; there are no sound effects. Just a picture of an animal under a Creative Commons licence from Wikipedia, and some lo-fi acoustic beats <span>looping</span> endlessly in the background. No running, no jumping, no guns, no baddies, no special moves or power-ups or puzzles. Are the Stroke games even video games at all?</p>
            <p>“It depends how you define ‘game’,” says Gardner. “There is interaction – granted, that interaction is very limited, but it is there, and there is a goal … I’ll happily admit it’s not hard, it’s not complex, but it is still a video game.”</p>
            <p>Looking at the figures provided by Gardner, perhaps it doesn’t matter – at least to his bank manager. Since launching in September 2022, the Stroke games have been downloaded more than 120,000 times, amassing over £275,000 in sales. Sony takes a 30% cut for hosting the game in the PlayStation Store, leaving Gardner with a pre-tax profit of more than £190,000.</p>
            <p>No one is buying these titles for the addictive gameplay, gripping storyline or <span>whizzy</span> visuals. So what’s the attraction?</p>
            <p>It all started in the mid-2000s, when console manufacturers began rewarding players with virtual <span>accolades</span> for completing extra objectives within games. These are called Achievements on Xbox, and Trophies on PlayStation. A new subculture emerged, established by a community of gamers who play for prizes rather than pleasure. They are known as trophy hunters. Some will go to any lengths in the pursuit of glory, perhaps even playing Hannah Montana: The Movie: The Game.</p>
            <p>The PlayStation Store became populated with dozens of games aimed at these players: low cost, laughably simplistic titles, offering easy trophies in exchange for a few <span>quid</span>. Gardner, who had a partner and toddler to support, had recently taught himself to code (“mostly from YouTube videos and online tutorials”) and saw an opportunity.</p>
            <p>“It was a bit of a struggle, with a young family, going from paycheck to paycheck,” he says. At that time, says Gardner, anyone could apply to sell a game on the PlayStation Store, and submit a design document <span>outlining</span> how it would work. “I had a look through Sony’s back end, and saw it was actually quite easy to get through their quality assurance,” he says. In 2022, his first game, Stroke the Dog, sailed into the Store without any issues. “So then I tried a few more, obviously with slightly different animals.”</p>
            <p>Stroke the Hamster is the bestseller, with more than 11,000 downloads. Cats are the second most popular animals for stroking, followed – perhaps surprisingly – by tortoises. But what was the inspiration behind Gardner’s <span>magnum opus</span>, Stroke the Beaver?</p>
            <p>“I’ll be honest, at one point it sort of became a joke to me,” he says. “I thought, I’ll see how far I can push it.” Quite far, it seems. Gardner then released Stroke the Dik-Dik. “It’s an animal, yeah?”</p>
            <p>Not everyone found the games funny. Internet forums are full of posts condemning trophy hunter titles, the people who make them, and Sony for allowing them into the PlayStation Store at all. Gardner has attempted to address the criticism, admitting the Stroke games are <span>shovelware</span>, and winning some defenders among the critics.</p>
            <p>“He found a niche and exploited it,” wrote forum user the1andonly654. “More power to him … Which company doesn’t do that? All the Call of Duties, FIFAs and Assassin’s Creeds are not that much different, in essence.”</p>
            <p>Of course, there’s a vast difference in terms of how much time, money and creative <span>endeavour</span> is invested in those games, and the richness of the experience they offer. But there are similarities in the business models: new instalments are <span>churned out</span> frequently, with a view to exploiting an existing market. There is an emphasis on reskinning the visuals, rather than developing new ideas.</p>
            <p>There’s an argument that Gardner’s Stroke games represent a more honest transaction than, say, loot boxes with randomised in-game rewards. At least when you buy a Stroke game, Gardner says, “you know exactly what you’re buying. There’s nothing in there to take advantage of you … Or to suggest you have to buy the other ones. If you don’t want to buy it, you don’t need to buy it.” He hasn’t had many complaints – of the 11,105 people who have bought Stroke the Hamster, only 10 have asked for a refund.</p>
            <p>But the critical voices remain, and it appears Sony is listening. In November 2022, the platform holder reportedly began a <span>crackdown</span> on shovelware, threatening in emails sent to developers to delist trophy hunter games and terminate their creators’ publisher accounts.</p>
            <p>It’s hard to see evidence of this policy in action on the PlayStation Store, though, which is still full of such titles. Sony didn’t seem to mind when, last December, Gardner released Stroke the Animals – a <span>bumper</span> offering featuring 10 creatures. (“Do you,ike aminales?” [sic], reads the game info. “Great! Well we have a load of them that you can stroke, so start stroking them.”) Perhaps it’s not such a mystery why Sony hasn’t cracked down: thanks to that 30% cut, the company has made more than £80,000 from the Stroke games.</p>
            <p>The first thing Gardner did with his share of the profits was to pay off his debts. Then he decided it was time to turn his attention away from shovelware: “I did get to the stage where I thought I’d try something a bit different, because while it’s making money, it’s not the most rewarding, as you can probably imagine.” One of his new projects is a new website, gameachievements.net. Launching in a couple of months, it will allow players to track their in-game awards across multiple platforms.</p>
            <p>So does Gardner have any regrets?</p>
            <p>“I’ll be honest – no,” he says. “I did it for my family, so I’m never going to regret anything I do to help them.”</p>

            <b>Source:</b>
            <a href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-creativity-art-computer-program'>Science News</a>
            <p>When British artist Harold Cohen met his first computer in 1968, he wondered if the machine might help solve a mystery that had long puzzled him: How can we look at a drawing, a few little <span>scribbles</span>, and see a face? Five years later, he devised a robotic artist called AARON to explore this idea. He equipped it with basic rules for painting and for how body parts are represented in portraiture — and then <span>set it loose</span> making art.</p>
            <p>Not far behind was the composer David Cope, who <span>coined</span> the phrase “musical intelligence” to describe his experiments with artificial intelligence–powered composition. Cope once told me that as early as the 1960s, it seemed to him “perfectly logical to do creative things with algorithms” rather than to <span>painstakingly</span> draw by hand every word of a story, note of a musical composition or brush stroke of a painting. He initially <span>tinkered</span> with algorithms on paper, then in 1981 moved to computers to help solve a case of composer’s block.</p>
            <p>Cohen and Cope were among a <span>handful</span> of eccentrics pushing computers to go against their nature as cold, calculating things. The still-<span>nascent</span> field of AI had its focus set <span>squarely</span> on solid concepts like reasoning and planning, or on tasks like playing chess and checkers or solving mathematical problems. Most AI researchers <span>balked at</span> the notion of creative machines.</p>
            <p>Slowly, however, as Cohen and Cope <span>cranked out</span> a stream of academic papers and books about their work, a field emerged around them: computational creativity. It included the study and development of autonomous creative systems, interactive tools that support human creativity and mathematical approaches to modeling human creativity. In the late 1990s, computational creativity became a formalized area of study with a growing <span>cohort</span> of researchers and eventually its own journal and annual event.</p>
            <p>Soon enough — thanks to new techniques rooted in machine learning and artificial neural networks, in which connected computing nodes attempt to <span>mirror</span> the workings of the brain — creative AIs could absorb and internalize real-world data and identify patterns and rules that they could apply to their creations.</p>
            <p>Computer scientist Simon Colton, then at Imperial College London and now at Queen Mary University of London and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, spent much of the 2000s building the Painting Fool. The computer program analyzed the text of news articles and other written works to determine the <span>sentiment</span> and extract keywords. It then combined that analysis with an automated search of the photography website Flickr to help it generate painterly collages in the mood of the original article. Later the Painting Fool learned to paint portraits in real time of people it met through an attached camera, again applying its “mood” to the style of the portrait (or in some cases refusing to paint anything because it was in a bad mood).</p>
            <p>Similarly, in the early 2010s, computational creativity turned to gaming. AI researcher and game designer Michael Cook dedicated his Ph.D. thesis and early research associate work at Goldsmiths, University of London to creating ANGELINA — which made simple games based on news articles from The Guardian, combining current affairs text analysis with hard-coded design and programming techniques.</p>
            <p>During this era, Colton says, AIs began to look like creative artists in their own right — incorporating elements of creativity such as intentionality, skill, appreciation and imagination. But what followed was a focus on <span>mimicry</span>, along with controversy over what it means to be creative.</p>
            <p>New techniques that excelled at classifying data to high degrees of precision through repeated analysis helped AI master existing creative styles. AI could now create works like those of classical composers, famous painters, novelists and more.</p>
            <p>One AI-authored painting modeled on thousands of portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries sold for $432,500 at auction. In another case, study participants struggled to differentiate the musical phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach from those created by a computer program called Kulitta that had been trained on Bach’s compositions. Even IBM got in on the fun, tasking its Watson AI system with analyzing 9,000 recipes to devise its own cuisine ideas.</p>
            <p>But many in the field, as well as onlookers, wondered if these AIs really showed creativity. Though sophisticated in their mimicry, these creative AIs seemed incapable of true innovation because they lacked the capacity to incorporate new influences from their environment. Colton and a colleague described them as requiring “much human intervention, supervision, and highly technical knowledge” in producing creative results. Overall, as composer and computer music researcher Palle Dahlstedt puts it, these AIs <span>converged</span> toward the mean, creating something typical of what is already out there, whereas creativity is supposed to diverge away from the typical.</p>
            <p>In order to make the step to true creativity, Dahlstedt suggested, AI “would have to model the causes of the music, the conditions for its coming into being — not the results.”</p>
            <p>True creativity is a quest for originality. It is a recombination of disparate ideas in new ways. It is unexpected solutions. It might be music or painting or dance, but also the flash of inspiration that helps lead to advances on the order of light bulbs and airplanes and the periodic table. In the view of many in the computational creativity field, it is not yet attainable by machines.</p>
            <p>In just the past few years, creative AIs have expanded into style invention — into authorship that is individualized rather than imitative and that projects meaning and intentionality, even if none exists. For Colton, this element of intentionality — a focus on the process, more so than the final output — is key to achieving creativity. But he wonders whether meaning and authenticity are also essential, as the same poem could lead to vastly different interpretations if the reader knows it was written by a man versus a woman versus a machine.</p>
            <p>If an AI lacks the self-awareness to <span>reflect</span> on its actions and experiences, and to communicate its creative intent, then is it truly creative? Or is the creativity still with the author who fed it data and directed it to act?</p>
            <p>Ultimately, moving from an attempt at thinking machines to an attempt at creative machines may transform our understanding of ourselves. Seventy years ago Alan Turing — sometimes described as the father of artificial intelligence — devised a test he called “the imitation game” to measure a machine’s intelligence against our own. “Turing’s greatest insight,” writes philosopher of technology Joel Parthemore of the University of Skövde in Sweden, “lie in seeing digital computers as a mirror by which the human mind could consider itself in ways that previously were not possible.”</p>

                <b>The curious case of acupuncture</b>
            </p>
            <p>John Marino was the most driven man I ever met, a monomaniac on a mission to break the U.S. transcontinental cycling record — which he did in 1980, covering the 3,000 miles in 12 days, three hours. I wanted to be like John, so that year I took up serious cycling. In addition to pedaling hundreds of miles a week with him, I followed his training <span>regimen</span> of vegetarian meals, megavitamin dosing, fasting, colonics, mud baths, iridology (iris reading), negative ions, chiropractic, massage and acupuncture.</p>
            <p>Although most of the <span>nostrums</span> I tried were useless, I noted with interest (because he beat me) that Jonathan Boyer, the winner of the 1985 Race Across America (co-founded by Marino and me), had a Chinese acupuncturist on his support crew. Given the successes of Marino and Boyer, it seemed possible that there might be a biomedical connection.</p>
            <p>Traditional Chinese medicine holds that a life energy called Qi (“chee”) flows through meridians in the body; each of the 12 main meridians represents a major organ system. On these 12 meridians are 365 acupuncture points, one for each day of the year. When yin and yang are out of balance, Qi can become blocked, leading to illness. Inserting needles at blocked points — believed to number about 1,000 — supposedly stimulates healing and health.</p>
            <p>This theory lacks any basis in biological reality, because nothing like Qi has ever been found by science. Nevertheless, a medicinal procedure like acupuncture may work for some other reason not related to the original, <span>erroneous</span> theory. Electroacupuncture—the electrical stimulation of tissues through acupuncture needles — increases the effectiveness of analgesic (pain-relieving) acupuncture by as much as 100 percent over traditional acupuncture. So says George A. Ulett, a practicing physician and acupuncturist (with both an M.D. and Ph.D.) and author of the 1992 <i>Beyond Yin and Yang: How Acupuncture Really Works</i> and the 2002 textbook <i>The Biology of Acupuncture</i> (both published by Warren H. Green in St. Louis). Ulett <span>posits</span> that electroacupuncture stimulates the release of such neurochemicals as beta-endorphin, enkephalin and dynorphin, leading to pain relief. In fact, he says, the needles are not even needed — electrically stimulating the skin (transcutaneous nerve stimulation) is sufficient. Ulett cites research in which, using this technique, the amount of gas anesthetic in surgery was reduced by 50 percent.</p>
            <p>These findings might help explain the results of a study published in the May 4, 2005, issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, in which Klaus Linde and his colleagues at the University of Technology in Munich compared the experiences of 302 people suffering from migraines who received either acupuncture, <span>sham</span> acupuncture (needles inserted at nonacupuncture points) or no acupuncture. During the study, the patients kept headache diaries. Subjects were “blind” to which experimental group they were in; the evaluators also did not know whose diary they were reading. Professional acupuncturists administered the treatments. The results were dramatic: “The proportion of responders (reduction in headache days by at least 50%) was 51% in the acupuncture group, 53% in the sham acupuncture group, and 15% in the waiting list group.” The authors concluded that this effect “may be due to nonspecific physiological effects of needling, to a powerful placebo effect, or to a combination of both.”</p>
            <p>In my experience, “needling” (where the acupuncturist <span>taps</span> and twists the flesh-embedded needle) isn’t painful, but it is most definitely noticeable. If acupuncture has effects beyond placebo, it is through the physical stimulation and release of the body’s natural painkillers. Finding that sham acupuncture is as effective as “real” acupuncture demonstrates that the Qi theory is full of holes. The effects of being poked by needles, however, cannot be ignored. Understanding the psychology and neurophysiology of acupuncture and pain will lead to a better theory. And for all such alternative medicine claims, testimonials can <span>steer</span> us in the direction of where to conduct research; science is the only tool that can tell us whether they really work or not.</p>
